# Phase 1: Separate Monolith by Domain
*Clone the monolith application and we will decompose it into microservices together.*

In this phase we will break apart a monolithic application into multiple smaller services that together form a single microservice application. The application in use is the Quiz Application that has Flashcards for studying different topics, and quizzes that are tied to specific flashcards. The original monolithic application has tight coupling between the Flashcards and Quizzes, so in this phase we will overcome that using RestTemplate for interservice communication.

The end result of this phase will be provided for comparison.
